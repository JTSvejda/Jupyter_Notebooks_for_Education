# Jupyter Notebooks for Education: A Collection of Examples for Electrical Engineers

This is a collection of several jupyter notebooks with example python scripts.

Some of the notebooks might up to now only be aviable in german language.

Most of the here presented notebooks and python scripts are used within several lectures at the Department of Theoretical Electrical Engineering (ATE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany (https://www.ate.uni-duisburg-essen.de/).

To get startet, just click one of the given links in the contents sections.
You will be redirected to `https://mybinder.org/` where the script is loaded and you can interactively run and edit as you like.
After loading, simply press the button on the top with the double arrow symbol.
This will freshly start the python process and already performs all sections of the script.
For further instructions, please have a look into the jupyter documentation: https://jupyter.org/documentation

With this I wish you then lots of fun and success in learning.
